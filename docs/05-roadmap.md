## Staking testnet: live

The [Diva Staking Goerli testnet](https://stake.diva.community) is live! It allows you to:

- ✅ Stake and withdraw your ETH.
- ✅ Wrap and unwrap your divETH into wdivETH.
- 🔜 Rewards Reporting

There is also a [Dune Analytics dashboard for Diva testnet](https://dune.com/anchor/diva-goerli-network-dashboard) to visualize network data.


## 🛣️  Operator testnet: in process

Diva's goal is that *anyone* can run a node to operate the network and generate [Staking Rewards](staking-rewards) + [Operator Rewards](economics).

Diva Operator Testnet is live and open to anyone, currently supporting:

- ✅ Create and operate validators using Diva's native DVT
- 🔜 ZKP Reward Oracles
- 🔜 Collateral & Operator Rewards
- 🔜 MEV support
- 🔜 Governance and Tokenomics
- 🔜 Withdrawals and Exits

This will allow Liquid Stakers, Operators and the Diva DAO to fully finalize its design and possibilities, so everybody can use divETH without the need to trust any centralized or permissioned party.

**Mainnet deployment** ETA is Q1. Diva mainnet will launch once the last functionalities are fully tested and audited.
