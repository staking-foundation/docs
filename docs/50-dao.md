# The Diva DAO

## The motivation for Diva

:::info
**ðŸŒ³ Diva has been conceived as a public good, for the benefit of Ethereum Stakers and the ecosystem at large ðŸŒ³**
:::

Diva is an automated and trustless software that extends Ethereum with additional functionality for Stakers and Operators.

This allows it to provide [Liquid Staking](lst) powered [Distributed Validation](dvt) in a [permissionless and trustless](features) manner, without extracting any protocol fees.

The Diva DAO is entrusted with deciding on the final parameters for the launch and operation of the Diva staking protocol at launch.

## The Diva DAO

The Diva DAO represents its users via the Delegated DIVA token holders, who can exercise voting power.

Delegated Diva Token holders are entrusted to govern it as a public good.

There is a fixed total supply of 1,000,000,000 DIVA tokens. DIVA tokens which aren't effectively delegated are not taking into account for governance purposes.

Each Delegated DIVA token is worth 1 vote on decisions such as:

- Deploying the Diva Smart Contracts.
- Curating Diva by adjusting network parameters (if any).
- Evangelizing for the Diva staking protocol.

DIVA is currently [non-transferrable](distribution#non-transferability). If you're looking to earn potential DIVA tokens, check the [Early Stakers initiative](early_stakers).

The Diva DAO components are fully decentralized:

- The DIVA contract is [0xbfabde619ed5c4311811cf422562709710db587d](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbfabde619ed5c4311811cf422562709710db587d).
- The [Diva Staking DAO Governor source code & docs](https://github.com/staking-foundation/diva-governor) are on Github.
- [Governance proposals](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva) are on Tally.
- [Discussion forum](https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussions) for community conversations on Commonwealth.

In order to become DAO members, token holders must accept their role by delegating their vote to a delegate or to themselves.
