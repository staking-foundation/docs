# Installing Diva Operator testnet

Diva is currently in Testnet ([check the 🛤️ Roadmap ](roadmap)), and the exact requirements are still being explored.

## Operator setup

In the current version, no collateral is required! Key shares are sent automatically to live operators.

But this will change in future versions.

Diva Operators will require to post at least 1 Goerli ETH (testnet) as [collateral](glossary#collateral) to receive their first key share. If you need some Goerli ETH, [you can ask for it in the community Discord](https://discord.gg/diva).

There are three ways to run a Diva node:

1. **An all-in-one Diva node**, which automatically installs the Ethereum client dependencies (EL/CL/VC clients).

This requires a virtual or physical machine with the [specifications to run a full Ethereum node](https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/):

  - 📦 An operating system supporting Docker, ideally Linux
  - 🤖 CPU: 4 cores minimum, 8 cores recommended. *(ARM hasn't been tested yet)*
  - 🧠 RAM: 8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended. *(We recommend higher amounts than the Ethereum Foundation's minimums)*
  - 🍱 Hard drive: 2 TB SSD drive.
  - Recommended: Wired internet connection

2. **Using the Dappnode package** which is under development.

3. **Connecting Diva to an existing Ethereum node**. In this case the requirements are much lower, as the Ethereum node does all the heavy lifting. It is recommended to use a dedicated Ethereum node that's isolated from other services to avoid accidental failures.
