description: Learn the story of Diva Staking
---

In 2022, the blockchain space suffered greatly with the collapse of major funds and exchanges. This was enabled by opaque and poorly managed entities, contrary to the open and transparent values of Ethereum.

And yet in 2023, Ethereum's Proof of Stake is still operated by centralized entities. This needs to change!

As Ethereum-aligned community members, we believe the answer is more transparent cryptoeconomic “can't-be-evil” systems.

## The Diva story

Diva was born out of an [initial DVT staking implementation](https://github.com/pradavc/bubls) from co-founding cryptographers Miguel Prada and Fernando, further developed from Apr 2023 with the help of contributors Diego, Francisco, Raúl and Pablo.

The core idea of Diva is to power Liquid Staking by Distributed Validation, using cryptoeconomic systems that allow any network participant to fulfil their staking tasks more efficiently.

## Meet some of the Divas

[**Miguel Prada**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maprada/) leads [Shamir Labs](shamir), the entity developing the first implementation of Diva Staking, together with an experienced engineering team. He is a veteran cryptographer with [18 publications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maprada/details/publications/?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAu_r9oBw41Uo-_zE98FA76LvKhAOJcku0o) and [3 patents](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maprada/details/patents/?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAu_r9oBw41Uo-_zE98FA76LvKhAOJcku0o) covering blockchain, identity, randomness, electronics, and distributed systems.

[**Raúl Calvo**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raulcalvosanchez/) is a DeFi & blockchain specialized lawyer advising Diva on decentralization design. He is responsible for the unique design of the [Diva Staking DAO](dao), with guest posts like [Diva's Unconvential Approach to Decentralized Governance](https://medium.com/@divastaking/diva-staking-a-unique-approach-to-decentralized-governance-and-empowering-curation-cdd1d7ad47a9).

[**Pablo**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micho/) is a serial entrepreneur, now leading [The Staking Foundation](foundation), engaging the community & ecosystem to educate about the unique advantages of Diva Staking. You'll find him often in the community Discord.

Unlike in many other DAOs, none of the co-founders participate in governance, paving the way to a fully community-led ecosystem.
