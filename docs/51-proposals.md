# Discussions & Proposals

Diva Staking's DAO governance offers space for both on-chain and off-chain discussions.

**Here's how you can contribute now to shaping the Diva Staking Protocol:**

- 🗣️ Starting or participating in forum discussions on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1041618287500460083/1129055607148773386) or [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussions).
- ⛓️ [Submitting or voting on DAO proposals](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva) for on-chain decisions.
- 🖥️ Being an active participant as a [Liquid Staker](https://stake.diva.community) or [Operator during testnet](https://docs.staking.foundation/operators).

All participants in the DAO are strongly encouraged to follow the [Diva DAO community guidelines](https://github.com/staking-foundation/diva-dao/blob/main/Community-Guidelines.md), which are maintained by the community.


## Step 1: Community Discussions

Before any decision is put up for voting, you can simply start an informal discussion about any thoughts/idea/questions you may have.

Topics can be things like better designs for Diva Staking, suggestions on how to organize the community, research & development topics, or decentralization initiatives.

Community members are encouraged to participate, following the [DAO community guidelines](https://github.com/staking-foundation/diva-dao/blob/main/Community-Guidelines.md). Forums are open to anyone, as it is important to socialize ideas and gather community feedback before moving on to action.

💬 Participate on discussions or suggest new ideas on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1041618287500460083/1129055607148773386) or [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussions)!

## Step 2: Proposal Drafting

Some discussions will result in a DAO proposal which can be put up for voting.

DAO proposals can simply result in community decisions, like agreements on guidelines, procedures, forming committees, etc. Many proposals do not need to execute code on-chain.

However, **DAO proposals can contain on-chain instructions to be executed by the DAO**, for example:

- Transferring tokens, making payments.
- Deploying smart contracts.
- Changing protocol parameters.

That's what the Diva DAO is for! On-chain code is executed by Ethereum in a resilient and decentralized way.

**Remember, you can only become a DAO member by delegating your DIVA tokens!** Delegated token holders are tasked with the goal of shaping the protocol and increasing its utility, resiliency, and decentralization - Ultimately, the DAO is tasked with making the Diva Staking Protocol better.


### Three Types of Proposals

1. **Diva Curation Proposal (DCP)**
    - Intended to distribute governance power among communities.
    - Requires +50% favorable votes to be enacted.
2. **Diva Improvement Proposal (DIP)**
    - Aiming to adapt or modify a configurable feature.
    - Requires +66% favorable votes to be enacted.
3. **Diva Update Proposal (DUP)**
    - Complex proposals aiming to update the Diva Protocol core infrastructure.
    - Requires +75% favorable votes to be enacted.


## Step 3: Temperature check 

In order for a proposal to be formally considered by the community, an off-chain process referred to as ‘temperature check’ must be followed. The goal is to evaluate proposal interest and community support before voting.

The temperature check is done through dedicated threads the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1041618287500460083/1129055607148773386) or [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussions) community forums.

### Suggested “temperature check” format

**Title:** “NDP + [brief description]”

**Brief description:** 
- Short and concise description of the proposal
- Rationale: why the proposal is necessary and what benefit will bring to the community
- Tentative classification as DCP, DIP and DUP
- A community poll to indicate the flag the level of support the proposal may have


## Step 4: Submit DAO Proposal

Proposals require at least 1M D-DIVA delegated and an on-chain transaction, submitted on [Tally](https://tally.xyz/gov/diva).

The proposal shall include the following structure:

- Short name of the proposal
- Definition as DCP, DIP or DUP
- Content:
  - DCP Proposals shall include a short description of the proposed action to be taken
  - DIP Proposals shall include a risk assessment of the proposed implementation of such proposal and the executable code (Tally provides a list of executable functions which can be implemented)
  - DUP Proposals; this shall include a thorough description of the technical features aimed to be implemented, executable code and test cases.

Any proposal shall include a copyright waver. Further, any code or material included in any proposal shall be open sourced and released to the public domain without any restriction whatsoever.


## Step 5: Voting

After on-chain creation, there is a **2-day waiting period** for any DIVA token holder to delegate their tokens. Only DAO tokens (delegated DIVA tokens or D-DIVAs) are accounted towards the governance quorum.

Proposals have a predetermined **3-day voting period** upon submission, allowing D-DIVA holders to vote in favor or object. If the proposal meets a valid quorum (10M D-DIVA) and voting threshold, it becomes a DAO Resolution!


## Step 6: Execution

After meeting the threshold and quorums, an on-chain transaction sets the approved DAO Resolution in a queue for execution, starting a Cooldown Period. Once the Cooldown period ends, anyone can execute the transaction to implement a DAO Resolution.

DAO Resolutions can be challenged to prevent security issues like governance attacks or fraudulent code implementation. A Cancellation Proposal must be submitted by a community participant with at least 1M D-tokens delegated.

More details about voting can be found in the [DAO community guidelines](https://github.com/staking-foundation/diva-dao/blob/main/Community-Guidelines.md). Some DAO parameters can be modified via DAO proposals.
