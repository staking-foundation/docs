## Designed for compatibility

Diva's Liquid Staking is design to work just like popular staking protocols:

- [Anyone can stake with Diva](participants) with no minimum ETH.requirement
- [divETH and wdivETH](lst) allow for easy integration in Defi.

Diva staking rewards are expected to be similar to major protocols, as the source of its rewards is the Beacon Chain itself.

However, Diva Operators can expect higher divETH rewards by operating their own nodes to power the network.

## Diva's unique advantage

Diva uses [its own DVT](dvt) to provide better uptime and risk management with no centralized parties:

- Node redundancy delivers significantly better uptime (*~500x better!*)
- Protection against single nodes failing or acting maliciously.
- A permissionless Operator network that anyone can join, favoring diversity.
