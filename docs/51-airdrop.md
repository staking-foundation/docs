# First airdrop

Some community members are being offered the chance to become early DIVA holders.

The recipients of the DIVA Airdrop include early supporters/contributors in the ecosystem that have provided impactful contribution to the building of Diva — who we affectionately refer to as OGs.

This consists of, but is not limited to, Diva Testnet stakers, current active community participants, early supporters, investors, and advisors. 

### Why are we doing it

The purpose of this airdrop is to involve early contributors in the decisions of how make the protocol better. Additionally, this airdrop demonstrates Diva’s commitment to building a system that has decentralization at its core. 

## Pure governance

As Diva prepares to revolutionize the Ethereum space with its staking protocol powered by DVT, the underlying principles of decentralization, community engagement, and democratic decision-making remain at the forefront.

💠 It is our deep intention to uphold inclusivity as high as decentralization. That being said, if you were not included in this initial airdrop, there will be more opportunities to earn rewards as an early contributor as we continue to build on the road to Mainnet. ⚡️
