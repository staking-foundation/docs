# Diva's Liquid Staking

Diva is an Ethereum Liquid Staking protocol powered by Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).

It extends Ethereum's Proof of Stake providing new functionality for Stakers and Operators:

- **Liquid Stakers** receive divETH, a [Liquid Staking Token](lst) which generates Ethereum [Staking Rewards](staking-rewards).
- **Operators** run a [**Di**stributed **Va**lidation node](operators) to fulfill staking duties and earn additional [Operator Rewards](economics).

Ethereum’s staking rewards are distributed among the Diva network participants according to their contributions.

divETH is a receipt token and its balance updates daily to reflect the deposited ETH balance plus its Ethereum staking rewards.

While other solutions have some of these features, **Diva is the first solution that fully integrates Liquid Staking with [Distributed Validation](dvt)**, offering both Liquid Stakers and Operators the most efficient functionality.

## Diva Rewrites the Rules

### Liquid Staking

- 🌱 No minimum ETH to stake.
- 👏 No requirement to run a node.
- 💧 [Liquid Staking Tokens](lst) without lockups.

### More Resilient Operations

- 🌳 Resilient: Nodes are fully disposable.
- ❤️‍🔥 Self-healing: Ability to regenerate lost keys.
- 💠 Redundancy: ~500x better uptime thanks to [DVT fallbacks](dvt).

### Incentives and Penalties

- 📈 Smooth [Staking Rewards](staking-rewards).
- ⛔️ Quick ejection of bad actors.

### Trust-minimized Architecture

- 🪨 [Trustless and permissionless](features).
- 🔐 "Can't be evil" cryptographic systems.
- 🛡️ [Collateral protection for Stakers](participants#operators).
